A LaTeX class (iitmdiss.cls) along with a simple template thesis
(thesis.tex) and synopsis (synopsis.tex) are provided here.  These can
be used to easily write a thesis (or synopsis) suitable for submission
at IIT-Madras.  The class provides options to format PhD, MS,
M.Tech. and B.Tech. thesis.  It also allows one to write a synopsis
using the same class file.  Also provided is a BIBTeX style file
(iitm.bst) that formats all bibliography entries as per the IITM
format.  A simple sample bibliography file (refs.bib) is also
provided.

For convenience, I've also included Stephan I. B"ottcher's lineno
package that allows one to add line numbers to each line of a LaTeX
document.


Compile the sample thesis like so: 

% latex thesis.tex
% bibtex thesis
% latex thesis.tex
% latex thesis.tex

Please read thesis.dvi for more details.
