 \emph{All Pairs Shortest Path} ($\textsc{APSP}$) problem is one of the most fundamental problems in graph theory. 
 The all pairs shortest path problem on a graph $G$ is to compute shortest path between all the pairs of vertices of $G$.
 One of the most interesting ways to approach this problem is by preprocesssing the graph and setup a data structure that 
 can efficiently answer queries of distance between any pair of vertices. 
 This data structure is referred as $\emph{distance oracle}$ of the graph.
 
 We preprocess a given undirected chordal graph $G = (V,E)$ on $n$ vertices in $O(n^2)$
 time and space to build a data structure of size $O(n)$ such that any subsequent distance
 query can be answered in constant time with a bounded constant factor error. 
 In particular, for each pair of vertices $u_i,u_j\in V(G), 1 \leq i,j \leq n$, we output a distance value $d_{ij} \leq 2d_G(u_i,u_j)+8$, 
 where $d_G$ is the distance between $u_i$ and $u_j$ in $G$. Our improvement comes from a relationship that we discover between the graph distance and
 minimum hitting sets of cliques on certain paths in a clique tree associated with a chordal graph.
 For a clique tree $T$ of $G$, let $u_i,u_j \in V$ and cliques $C_i$, $C_j \in T$, such that $u_i \in C_i$ and $u_j \in C_j$.
 We prove that the size of any minimum hitting set that hits all the cliques in the path joining $C_i$ and $C_j$ is upper bounded by 
 the number of vertices in any shortest path between $u_i$ and $u_j$ in $G$.
 By using this structural property of the clique trees, we show that \mbox{$d_{ij} \leq 2d_G(u_i,u_j)+8$}.
 We also prove that by keeping the size of 
 the hitting set of cliques on all paths originating from a single vertex in the clique tree, we can compute hitting set for the path joining 
 any pair of cliques in constant time. This observation helps us to design an efficient data structure to additively approximate (error of +3) these minimum
 hitting sets of cliques for all paths in the clique tree. This observation is important to answer distance queries in constant time.
 The most interesting features of our data structure is its constant query time in spite of the fact that it
 stores only $O(n)$ size data, i.e., it does not store distances between all the pairs explicitly.
 
 We will also present a survey of \emph{tree} $t$-\emph{spanner} for different classes of graphs. 
 In this thesis we will mostly concentrate on chordal graphs for both the problems, i.e., distance oracles and tree $t$-spanners.
 We will study the previous results in the area of spanners. We will also study previous research about the computational 
 complexity of the tree $t$-spanner.
