\section{Chordal Graphs}
 A graph $G = (V,E)$ is chordal if every cycle of length greater than three has a chord. 
 A chord is an edge connecting two non adjacent vertices of a cycle. 
 In this section we define and prove many characteristic properties of chordal graphs.
\subsection{Minimal Vertex Separator}
 A $\emph{separator}$ $S \subset V$ is subset of vertices such that $G \setminus S$ contains at least two connected component. 
 A separator $S$ is called as $\emph{xy-separator}$
 if $x,y \in V$ are in different connected components in $G \setminus S$. 
 If vertices are not specified, then $S$ is called as a $\emph{vertex separator}$.
 A vertex separator $S$ is $\emph{minimal vertex separator}$ if no proper subset of $S$ is a vertex separator.
\begin{theorem}[\cite{dirac}]
 A graph $G$ is chordal if and only if every minimal vertex separator of $G$ is a clique.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
 Let $G$ be a chordal graph and $S$ be a minimal vertex separator such that $x,y \in V$ are in different connected components in $G \setminus S$.
 Let $G(X)$ and $G(Y)$ be connected components of $G$ such that $x \in G(X)$ and $Y \in G(Y)$. Every vertex $u \in S$ is adjacent to a vertex in $G(X)$
 and a vertex in $G(Y)$, otherwise $S \setminus \{u\}$ is also a $xy$-separator, contradicting the minimality of $S$. Let $u,v \in S$. There must
 exist a path $\mu_1$ joining $u$ and $v$ such that all internal vertices of $\mu_1$ are in $G(X)$. Let $\mu_1$ is chosen such that
 length of $\mu_1$ is minimum over all such paths.
 Similarly, let $\mu_2$ be the shortest path joining $u$ and $v$ such that all vertices of $\mu_2$ are in $G(Y)$. Clearly, we can combine $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$
 to obtain a cycle of length greater then 3. Since, the length of cycle is greater than 3, it must contain a chord.
 This chord cannot join two vertices of $\mu_1$ otherwise it will contradict the fact that $\mu_1$ is a shortest path that connects $u$ and $v$ and
 all internal vertices of $\mu_1$ are in $G(X)$. Similarly, there is no possibility of chord in $\mu_2$. The only possibility of chord is between 
 $u$ and $v$. Therefore, $(u,v) \in E$. Similarly, we can prove that for every $u,v \in S$, $(u,v) \in E$. Therefore, $S$ is a clique.

\end{figure}
 
 For other direction, let $G$ be a graph such that every minimal vertex separator $S$ of $G$ is a clique. Let $[x_1,x_2,\dots,x_k,x_1]$ be a cycle 
 of length greater than 3 in $G$. If there exists a chord between $x_1$ and $x_3$ then we are done, otherwise there exists a minimal $x_1x_3$-separator $S$.
 Separator $S$ must contain $x_2$ and $x_i$, $4 \leq i \leq k$. We know that vertices of $S$ form a clique, therefore $(x_2,x_i) \in E$. Hence any 
 cycle of length greater then 3 must contain a chord.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Perfect Elimination Ordering}
 Perfect Elimination Ordering(PEO) is one of the most important properties of chordal graphs. We introduce the concept
 of simplicial vertex before defining PEO formally.
\begin{definition}
  A vertex $u \in V$ is called as simplicial vertex if $u$ and vertices present in adj($u$) form a clique.
\end{definition}
 Let $f = [v_1,v_2,\dots,v_n]$ be an ordering of vertices of $G$. $f$ is $\emph{perfect elimination ordering}$ if every $v_i \in V$ is simplicial 
 in the graph induced by the vertices $v_i,v_{i+1},\dots,v_n$. Equivalently, $f$ is perfect elimination ordering if, for each $v_i \in V$, $v_i$ and 
 the neighbors of $v_i$ which occur after $v_i$ in ordering, form a clique. 
\begin{lemma}[\cite{dirac}]\label{simplicial}
Every chordal graph $G$ has at least one simplicial vertex. If $G$ is not complete then it has two non-adjacent simplicial vertices.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
 If $G$ is complete then trivially every vertex of $G$ is simplicial. 
 If $G$ is not complete then we use induction on the number of vertices to prove existence of two non adjacent simplicial vertices. 
 Let $G$ be a chordal graph containing two non adjacent vertices $x$ and $y$.\\
 $\textbf{Base case}$.  Let $G$ be a graph with $n$ = 2 vertices. This case is trivial with both vertices simplicial as both are isolated.\\
 $ \textbf{Inductive hypothesis}$. Let every non-complete chordal graph $G$, having $n < k$ vertices, have two non-adjacent simplicial vertices.\\
 $ \textbf{Inductive step}$. Let $G$ be a chordal graph with $n = k$ vertices. 
 Let $x$,$y \in V$ be two non-adjacent vertices in $G$, and $S$ be a minimal $xy$-separator. 
 Let $G(X)$ and $G(Y)$ be the connected components of the graph, induced on the vertex set $V(G) \setminus S$, that contains $x$ and $y$, respectively. 
 Let $G'$ be a subgraph of $G$ induced by vertex set $G(X) \cup S$. 
 Clearly, $G'$ is a chordal graph with vertices less than $k$. 
 Hence, by inductive hypothesis either $G'$ has two non adjacent simplicial vertices (one of the them being in $G(X)$, as $S$ is minimal 
 vertex separator) or $G'$ must be a complete graph. $adj(X) \subset G(X) \cup S$ because $S$ separates $G(X)$ and $G(Y)$, 
 hence if $x' \in G(X)$ is simplicial in $G'$ it must be simplicial in $G$ also.
 In the same way we can argue that there must exist a simplicial vertex $y'$ in $G(Y)$. Clearly, $x'$ and $y'$ are non adjacent.
 Hence the claim. 
\end{proof}
\\
Now we use Lemma \ref{simplicial} to prove the fact that every chordal graph contains Perfect elimination ordering.
\begin{theorem}[\cite{fulkerson}]
 A graph $G$ is chordal if and only if it has a perfect elimination ordering.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
 Let $G$ be a graph and $f$ be the perfect elimination ordering of vertices of $G$. 
 Let $\mu = [v_p,v_{p+1},\dots,v_q,v_p]$ be a cycle of length greater then 3 in $G$. 
 Let $v_j \in \mu$ such that $v_j$ occurs before all vertices of $\mu$ in $f$. 
 Clearly, $v_{j-1}$ and $v_{j+1}$ are neighbors of $v_j$ and they occur after $v_j$ in $f$. 
 Therefore, $(v_{j-1},v_{j+1}) \in E$, i.e., every cycle of length greater then 3 has a chord in $G$.
 \par Let $G$ be a chordal graph. We use induction on the number of vertices of graph to prove existence of perfect elimination ordering in $G$.
 Base case, i.e., $n = 1$ is trivial because any graph with one vertex has perfect elimination ordering. 
 Let every chordal graph with less then $n$ vertices have perfect elimination ordering. Let $G$ be a chordal graph with $n$ vertices.
 By Lemma \ref{simplicial} $G$ has a simplicial vertex. Let $u \in V$ be simplicial in $G$. 
 Clearly, $G \setminus \{u\}$ is a chordal graph with fewer than $n$ vertices. 
 Therefore, by induction hypothesis, there exist a perfect elimination ordering in $G \setminus \{u\}$. 
 Perfect elimination ordering for $G$ is $u$ followed by perfect elimination ordering of $G \setminus \{u\}$. Hence the claim.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Clique Tree Representation}
Let $G =(V,E)$ be a graph. A clique of the graph $G$ is a set of maximal vertices that are complete in $G$. 
Also, no clique of a graph is properly contained in any other clique of the graph.
For a chordal graph $G$, let $\mathcal{K}_G$ be the set of maximal cliques of $G$.
There must exist a set of trees on $\mathcal{K}_G$ with some specific properties~\cite{blair} which are called as \emph{clique trees} of $G$.
A chordal graph can be represented in a very compact and efficient manner using clique tree of the graph.
Clique tree of a chordal graph possess a number of special properties, some of them are presented in this section.
For rest of this chapter we assume that $G$ is a chordal graph and $T$ is a clique tree of $G$ induced on set of maximal cliques  $\mathcal{K}_G$ of the graph $G$.
We also assume that $\mathcal{K}(v) \subseteq \mathcal{K}_G$ is the set of maximal cliques  which contains vertex $v$.
\begin{figure}

		\includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{ChordalAndClique.pdf}
	\caption{A Chordal Graph and its Corresponding Clique Tree}
\end{figure}
 \begin{definition}
 For every pair of cliques $\mathcal{K}, \mathcal{K}' \in \mathcal{K}_G$ of $G$. The set $\mathcal{K} \cap \mathcal{K}'$ is 
  present in all the cliques present in the path joining $\mathcal{K}$ and  $\mathcal{K}'$ in $T$. This property is called as clique intersection property.
 \end{definition}
 \begin{theorem}[\cite{blair}]
  Let $G$ be a chordal graph and $T$ is clique tree of $G$, then $T$ respects the clique intersection property.
 \end{theorem}
 \begin{proof}
  Proof is by induction on the number of vertices $n$ in $G$. For $n = 1$, $T$ contains only one clique which is the only vertex of $G$.
  Therefore, $T$ trivially satisfies clique intersection property. By $\emph{induction hypothesis}$,
  if the number of vertices in a chordal graph $G$ is less then $n$, then any clique tree $T$ of $G$ satisfies clique intersection property.
  Let $G$ be a chordal graph with $n$ vertices. If $G$ is complete then $T$ contains a single node and trivially satisfies
  clique intersection property. If $G$ is not connected, i.e., it contains connected components $G_1,G_2,\dots,G_k$, then
  clique trees of each $G_i$ satisfies clique intersection property by induction hypothesis. Let $T_i$ be a clique tree 
  of $G$. We join a node of $T_i$ to a node of $T_{i+1}$ ($i = 1,2,\dots,k$) to obtain a clique tree of $G$ that satisfies 
  clique intersection property. Let $G$ be connected but not complete. Let $v$ is a simplicial vertex of $G$ and 
  $\mathcal{K}$ be the clique containing $v$. Let $G'$ be the graph induced on vertex set $V \setminus \{v\}$.
  By induction hypothesis, any clique tree $T'$ of $G'$ satisfies clique intersection property. 
  Let $\mathcal{K}' = \mathcal{K} \setminus \{v\}$. We need to address two cases to prove the claim. 
  First, if $\mathcal{K}'$ is a maximal clique. It is easy to see that $\mathcal{K}_{G} = \mathcal{K}_{G'} \cup \mathcal{K} - \mathcal{K}'$. 
  Therefore, a clique tree $T$ for $G$ can be obtained by replacing node $\mathcal{K}'$ of $T'$ by $\mathcal{K}$. 
  The only difference between $T$ and $T'$ is the
  presence of $v$ in node $\mathcal{K}$ of $T$ which is not present in $\mathcal{K}'$ of $T'$. 
  Since $v$ is simplicial, therefore, $v$ is not present in any clique of $\mathcal{K}_G$ other than $\mathcal{K}$. 
  From the fact that $T'$ satisfies clique intersection property it is easy to see that  for any pair of cliques 
  $\mathcal{K}_i$ and $\mathcal{K}_j$ of $T$, $\mathcal{K}_i \cap \mathcal{K}_j$ is present in every clique joining
  in the path joining $\mathcal{K}_i$ and $\mathcal{K}_j$. Hence, $T$ also satisfies clique intersection property.
  \par Now, assume that $\mathcal{K}'$ is not a maximal clique of $G'$. Let $\mathcal{K}''$ be the clique such that 
  $\mathcal{K}' \subset \mathcal{K}''$. A clique tree $T$ for $G$ can be obtained by adding node $\mathcal{K}$ to
  $T'$ and making it adjacent to $\mathcal{K}''$. The path joining $\mathcal{K}$ and any other clique $\mathcal{K}_i$ in $T$
  must contain $\mathcal{K}''$ as $\mathcal{K}''$ is the only neighbor of $\mathcal{K}$.
  Since, $\mathcal{K} \setminus \{v\} = \mathcal{K}' \subset \mathcal{K}''$ and
  $v$ belongs to no clique in $\mathcal{K}_G \setminus \mathcal{K}$, it follows that $\mathcal{K}_i \cap \mathcal{K} \subset \mathcal{K}''$.
  We know that $T'$ satisfies clique intersection property, therefore $\mathcal{K} \cap \mathcal{K}_i = \mathcal{K}'' \cap \mathcal{K}_i$
  is present in every clique in the path joining $\mathcal{K}$ and $\mathcal{K}''$. Hence, in this case also
  $T$ satisfies clique intersection property. Hence the claim.
 \end{proof}
 
 \begin{definition}
 For every $v \in V$, the tree induced on $\mathcal{K}(v)$ is a subtree of $T$. This property is known as induced subtree property.
 \end{definition}
 
 \begin{theorem}
 
 \end{theorem}
 \section{Interval Graphs}
 Interval graph is an important subclass of chordal graph. The book on perfect graphs by Golumbic~\cite{golumbic}
 is an excellent reference for interval graphs.  An interval graph can be defined as the intersection
 graph of a family of intervals on real line.
 \begin{definition}
 Let $S = \{S_1,S_2,\cdots,S_n\}$ be a set of $n$ intervals. There exists an interval graph $G = (V,E)$
 corresponding to the set of intervals $S$. $G$ contains a vertex $v_i$ corresponding to each interval $S_i$.
 Also, two vertices $v_i$ and $v_j$ are connected by an edge if and only if $S_i$ and $S_j$ intersect 
 i.e., $(v_i,v_j) \in E$ if and only if $S_i \cap S_j \neq \phi$. 
 \end{definition}
  
 Being a subclass of chordal graphs, interval graphs respect all the properties of chordal graphs.
 Clearly, interval graphs do not contain any chordless cycle of length greater than three.
 Chordal graph must contain a simplicial vertex. Also, vertices of an interval graph can be 
 arranged in a sequence that satisfies property of perfect elimination ordering. Finally, clique tree of an 
 interval graphs is a path of cliques.
  \begin{figure}
	    \centering
		\includegraphics[scale = 0.6]{IntervalGraph.pdf}
	\caption{Interval Graph}
\end{figure}
 
 As in the case of chordal graphs, an optimal vertex coloring on an interval graph can be achieved
 in polynomial time by applying greedy coloring algorithm. However, unlike chordal graphs, tree $t$-spanner
 problem is polynomial time solvable for chordal graphs. Madanlal et al.~\cite{madanlal} have given an algorithm
 to construct tree 3-spanner for interval graphs.
 
 Interval graphs has a number of applications in the field of operational research, scheduling theory, population
 biology and bioinformatics. For example in resource allocation problem in operational research and scheduling 
 theory, each vertex represents an interval of time for which the resource is requested. Then, the number of colors
 required to optimally color the vertices of interval graph is equal to the number of resources required to 
 complete all the requests.
 
 \section{Split Graphs}
 Split Graph is another important subclass of chordal graphs in which the vertex set can be partitoned into
 a clique and an independent set.
 \begin{definition}
 A graph $G = (V,E)$ is split graph, if set $V$ of vertices can be partitioned into two two disjoint sets
 $C$ and $I$, where set of vertices in $C$ form a clique and set of vertices in $I$ form an independent set.
 \end{definition}
 
 A split graph may have more than one partitions into clique and independent sets. Complement of a split graph
 is also an split graph. Let $G = (V,E)$ be a split graph with $V = C \cup I$. Then, if $G' = (V',E')$ is the
 complement graph of $G$ then $G'$ is also split with $V' = V = C \cup I$, where  vertices in set $C$ form an
 independent set whereas vertices in set $I$ form a clique. 
 
 \begin{figure}
	    \centering
		\includegraphics[scale = 0.6]{SplitGraph.pdf}
	\caption{Split Graph}
\end{figure}
	
 Split graphs can be recognized by their degree sequence. Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices with degree sequence 
 $d_1 \geq d_2 \geq d_3 \geq \cdots \geq d_n$ and $k$ be the largest $i$ such that $d_i \geq i-1$. Then, $G$ is a
 split graph if and only if
 \begin{center}
 $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{i=k} d_i$ = $k(k-1) + \displaystyle\sum_{i=k+1}^{i=n} d_i$
 \end{center}
 Clearly, first k vertices with largest degree form the clique whereas the other vertices form the independent set 
 in $G$.
 \section{Other Subclasses of Chordal Graphs}
 \textbf{Strongly Chordal Graph.} A graph $G = (V,E)$ is strongly chordal graph if $G$ is a chordal graph
 and every cycle of length greater than five in $G$ has an odd chord, i.e., an edge that connects two vertices 
 which are odd distance apart.
 
 \noindent \textbf{\emph{k}-trees.} A $k$-tree is a chordal graph in which the size of all maximal cliques is $k$+1
 and the size of all minimal clique separators is $k$
 
 \noindent \textbf{Apollonian network Graph.} Aa Apollonian network graph $G$ is a chordal graph formed by the
 process of recursively subdividing a triangle into three smaller triangles.
  
 \noindent \textbf{Ptolemaic Graph.} A graph $G = (V,E)$ is Ptolemaic Graph if and only if for any four vertices
 $a,b,c,d \in V$ it satisfies $d_G(a,b) \cdot d_G(c,d) = d_G(a,c) \cdot d_G(b,d) + d_G(a,d) \cdot d_G(b,c)$.
 
 \noindent \textbf{Chordal Bipartite Graph} A graph $G$ is chordal bipartite graph if it belongs to the class of chordal graphs as well as the class of bipartite graphs.
