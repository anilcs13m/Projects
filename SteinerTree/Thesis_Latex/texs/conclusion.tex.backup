\section{Conclusions}
In this work we studied the \problemfont{Hitting Set} problem on a set of line segments i.e. the Guarding a Set of Segments problem. In doing so, we 
proposed a framework for solving the hitting set problem on hypergraphs whose vertices can be ordered with a certain property. This allowed us to 
obtain constant-factor approximation algorithm for Triangle-Free GSS instances. We also showed how GSS instances satisfying the Helly Property are 
also Triangle-Free GSS instances implying the same constant-factor approximation for them. Both the class of instances are NP-Hard to solve optimally. 
We also focused on the Outerplanar GSS instances and gave a 2-approximation for those instances. It remains open whether the Outerplanar GSS instances 
are polynomial-time solvable or not.

We also gave a new exact algorithm for optimally solving the GSS problem on Tree structures. The problem was studied from the Fixed Parameter 
Tractability aspect and we showed a quadratic kernel for the problem implying that the problem is Fixed Parameter Tractable. It remains open if there
is a better kernel for the problem or not.

\section{Future Work}  

In Section \ref{sec_epsilon} we saw that $\epsilon$-net lower bound for points and lines does not directly apply to the GSS instances. This leaves 
the possibility of existence of constant factor approximation for the hitting set on GSS instances open. Otherwise a different technique is necessary 
to prove the $\epsilon$-net lower bound for GSS instances. The lower bound can only be shown by GSS instances for which the underlying graph has girth 
3.
