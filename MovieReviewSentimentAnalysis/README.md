# Movies Reviews Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment Analysis, also referred to as Opinion Mining attempts to capture, what an author of a document opines or feels. 
For example, What a film reviewer thinks about a film, What an online shopping consumer thinks about the product that 
he has purchased, etc. If we have a knowledge of what kind of words or phrases convey a positive sentiment or a good sentiment, 
then the problem becomes relatively easy. Just a mere search would be sufficient. But the real challenge lies when the system 
itself has to ’learn’ which words convey positive sentiments and which words convey negative sentiments.


Sentiment analysis is essentially, a supervised learning technique for classifying and/or rating text documents or resources. 
That is, a labelled training data is available. Using these data, the program must learn how to classify a new document, 
what are the essential features that discriminate one class of documents from another, how to extract them etc.
